#### Playlist Detection Methods**Auto-import not working**

- `get_all_channel_playlists()` - Fetch all playlists for a channel with pagination- Check that "Enable automatic daily video import" is checked in settings

- `get_video_playlist_membership()` - Check which playlists contain a specific video- Verify WordPress cron is functioning (some hosts disable it)

- `is_video_in_playlist()` - Boolean check for video-playlist membership- Look for "EYSS Daily Import" entries in error logs

- `get_playlist_videos()` - Get all videos from a specific playlist- Test by temporarily setting import time to a few minutes from now

- Ensure server time zone is configured correctly

#### Performance Optimizations- Consider using a plugin like "WP Crontrol" to monitor scheduled tasks

- **Caching System**: API responses cached to reduce quota usage

- **Batch Processing**: Videos processed in batches to prevent timeouts**Auto-import running at wrong time**

- **Pagination Support**: Handles large playlists with proper pagination- Check your server's time zone settings

- The import time setting uses server time, not your local time
